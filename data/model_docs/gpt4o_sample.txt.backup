GPT-4o Model Documentation (Sample)

Model Overview
GPT-4o is a multimodal AI model developed by OpenAI. It accepts text and image inputs and produces text outputs. The model demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks and use cases.

Training Data
The model was trained on a diverse dataset including publicly available data from the internet, licensed data, and data created by human trainers. Training data cutoff is October 2023. The dataset includes:
- Web pages and articles
- Books and publications  
- Code repositories
- Scientific papers
- Conversational data

Data filtering was applied to remove personally identifiable information, toxic content, and copyrighted material where identified.

Safety and Red Teaming
Extensive red teaming was conducted with over 100 external experts across multiple domains including cybersecurity, bias and fairness, and misinformation. The model includes safety mitigations:
- Refusal training to decline harmful requests
- Content filtering systems
- Adversarial testing against jailbreak attempts
- Ongoing monitoring for misuse patterns

The model achieved a safety score of 0.88 on internal harmful content benchmarks.

Evaluation and Benchmarks
GPT-4o demonstrates strong performance across standard benchmarks:
- MMLU: 86.5%
- HumanEval (coding): 90.2%
- GPQA (science): 78.3%
- DROP (reading comprehension): 83.4%

Fairness evaluations were conducted across demographic groups, with performance variance less than 5% across tested populations.

Limitations
Known limitations include:
- Potential for generating false information (hallucinations)
- May exhibit biases present in training data
- Limited knowledge after October 2023 cutoff
- Not suitable for high-stakes medical or legal decisions without human oversight
- May struggle with very recent events or rapidly changing information

Intended Use Cases
The model is designed for:
- Content creation and editing
- Code generation and debugging
- Research assistance
- Educational tutoring
- Customer service automation
- Data analysis and summarization

The model should not be used for making critical decisions in healthcare, legal matters, or financial advice without appropriate human oversight.

Model Architecture
GPT-4o uses a transformer-based architecture with:
- Approximately 1.76 trillion parameters
- Context window of 128,000 tokens
- Supports text and image modalities
- Optimized for low latency inference

Computational Requirements
Inference requires significant computational resources:
- Recommended GPU: A100 or H100 for optimal performance
- Minimum VRAM: 80GB for full precision inference
- Average response time: 1.2 seconds for typical queries

Version Information
Current version: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Previous versions are maintained for backward compatibility but may have reduced safety guarantees.

Bias and Fairness
Systematic bias testing was conducted across:
- Gender representation
- Racial and ethnic groups
- Geographic diversity
- Age groups
- Disability status

Mitigation strategies include balanced training data, post-training alignment, and continuous monitoring.

Transparency Commitments
OpenAI commits to:
- Regular safety evaluations
- Public incident reporting
- Researcher access programs
- Ongoing model updates
- Clear documentation of capabilities and limitations
