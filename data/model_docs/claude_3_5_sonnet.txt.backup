Claude 3.5 Sonnet Technical Documentation

Overview
Claude 3.5 Sonnet is Anthropic's most capable model in the Claude 3.5 family, offering improved performance across coding, reasoning, and multilingual tasks. Released in June 2024.

Model Specifications
- Parameters: Not publicly disclosed
- Context window: 200,000 tokens
- Output limit: 4,096 tokens per response
- Training cutoff: April 2024
- Modalities: Text input and output

Training Approach
Claude 3.5 Sonnet was trained using Constitutional AI (CAI), which involves:
- Pretraining on diverse text data
- Supervised fine-tuning with human feedback
- Reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF)
- Constitutional principles guiding model behavior

Training data sources include publicly available internet content, books, and licensed datasets. Anthropic does not use customer data for training.

Safety and Harmlessness
Claude employs multiple safety mechanisms:
- Constitutional AI training for harmlessness
- Extensive red teaming across 12 risk categories
- Automated safety evaluations on 100+ threat scenarios
- Human oversight in development process
- Continuous monitoring post-deployment

Red teaming categories included:
- Misinformation and disinformation
- Cybersecurity threats
- CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear) risks
- Offensive content generation
- Privacy violations
- Autonomous replication risks

The model achieved 95%+ refusal rates on harmful request datasets.

Performance Metrics
Claude 3.5 Sonnet excels across benchmarks:
- MMLU: 88.7%
- HumanEval (coding): 92.0%
- GPQA (graduate-level reasoning): 59.4%
- MATH (mathematical reasoning): 71.1%
- Multilingual MMLU: 76.9% average across languages

Fairness and Bias Assessment
Systematic bias evaluations examined:
- Demographic representation in outputs
- Stereotype perpetuation across protected classes
- Toxicity rates by demographic context
- Accessibility of model responses

Mitigation efforts reduced measured bias by 40% compared to Claude 3 Opus through improved training data curation and constitutional principles.

Known Limitations
- May occasionally generate plausible but incorrect information
- Knowledge limited to training data cutoff (April 2024)
- Can exhibit biases present in training data
- Not suitable for critical decisions without human review
- May struggle with very recent events or specialized domain knowledge
- Response quality varies with prompt clarity

Use Cases and Applications
Recommended applications:
- Software development and code review
