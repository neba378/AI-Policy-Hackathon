POLICY MEMO: AUTOMATED COMPLIANCE INFRASTRUCTURE
================================================================================

TO: Elizabeth Kelly, Director, U.S. AI Safety Institute (NIST)
FROM: Team Policy Sentinel
DATE: November 23, 2025
SUBJECT: Proposal for Automated "Pre-Audit" Compliance Infrastructure

================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

THE CHALLENGE:
Current AI documentation (System Cards) is unstructured and unverified. Regulators
at NIST cannot manually audit the exploding number of models entering the market.

THE EVIDENCE:
We deployed "Policy Sentinel," an automated auditing engine, to analyze 7
major AI models. Our analysis reveals a critical gap: while models claim compliance,
"Ethical Considerations" documentation fails validation 100.0% of the time.

THE RECOMMENDATION:
NIST should adopt the Sentinel Open Standard for automated pre-market verification,
requiring a machine-readable "Confidence Score" >70% for all federal AI procurement.

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS (EMPIRICAL DATA)
================================================================================

1. DATASET SCOPE
   • Models Analyzed: 7
   • Companies Covered: 4
   • Total Assessments: 56

2. COMPLIANCE GAP
   • Overall Compliance Rate: 41.1%
   • Vague Documentation (<50% confidence): 58.9%
   • Below Audit Threshold (<70%): 37 assessments (66.1%)

3. CATEGORY ANALYSIS
   • Strongest: Performance Metrics (100.0%)
   • Weakest: Ethical Considerations (0.0%)
   • Gap: 100.0 percentage points

4. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE
   • Chi-square test p-value: 0.000034
   • Result: SIGNIFICANT
   • Interpretation: Category differences are NOT due to chance

5. EFFICIENCY GAIN
   • Manual audit: ~5 hours per model
   • Automated audit: ~30 seconds per model
   • Improvement: 600x faster

VISUAL EVIDENCE

   → Shows which models fail which categories (RED = failure)

Figure 2: confidence_gap.png
   → Shows "Verification Gap" - vendors use marketing language vs. technical evidence

POLICY RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

THE SENTINEL STANDARD (3-Step Process):

Step 1 (INGEST):
   Vendors submit documentation via Sentinel API

Step 2 (VERIFY):
   System flags any claim with <70% evidence confidence

Step 3 (CERTIFY):
   Only high-confidence submissions move to human review

OPERATIONAL FEASIBILITY:
   • Available TODAY (open-source implementation)
   • Full audit: 30 seconds vs 5 hours (600x faster)
   • Reduces regulatory burden on NIST by 99.7%

EQUITY IMPACT:
   • Levels playing field (small labs can self-audit for free)
   • Prevents "safety" from becoming a big-tech moat
   • Open-source standard ensures transparency

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

We cannot regulate what we cannot measure. Policy Sentinel transforms "AI Transparency"
from a vague principle into a MEASURABLE, ENFORCEABLE metric.

The data is clear: 58.9% of current documentation is too vague to audit.
The solution is ready: automated pre-audit reduces NIST's workload by 600x.

We urge NIST to adopt this architecture immediately.
